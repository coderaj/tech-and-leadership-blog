This is my first post on my new blog! Hello World!

Sincere thanks to those who guided me through to where I am now, proud and humble to be _standing on the shoulders of giants_

> I have promises to keep, And miles to go before I sleep, And miles to go before I sleep

Why this blog?

I've come across ebbs and flows in my professional career. This is one place to make notes, share and reflect both my technical and leadership learnings.

Inspired by,

Stan Lee, those ideas that _create_ super heroes out of everyday humans, that can save the world.
