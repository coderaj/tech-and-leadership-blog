_Wife:_ Not sleeping. Is everything ok?

_Jack:_ Not really. Had a conflict at work. How can people be so narrow minded?

_Wife:_ What happened?

_Jack:_ 2 weeks ago, there was a problem. Our team worked on a shared project with the team in Oregon for last 2 months and we merged our work, on a Friday evening. Things broke, tests were commented out and we were surprised it is not implemented correctly by Oregon team.

I promised our boss that the coming week, everything will be ready.

Our team worked over the weekend fixing the mess created and on Monday morning, I sent a frustrated email that we worked on the weekend and stating how inefficient low quality work that the other team's senior employee has done.

I also sent a note to the senior employee's manager that the work we performed over the weekend needs his review before we merge changes again.

_Wife:_ Wait. Are you saying you fixed something that you didn't own over a weekend without the knowledge of the other team and sent an email that the other team is inefficient?

_Jack:_ Isn't that the truth? Why should I hide this? No one listens to me.

_Wife:_ No wonder. What did your boss do? Does he know the other team well?

_Jack:_ Yes. They have been working together for few years I guess. He shared the email with the other team's manager seeking more details.

_Wife:_ Hmm.. Then?

_Jack:_ Instead of thanking us for getting the project back on track, the Oregon team is now turning hostile with less and less communication.

_Wife:_ Did you think Why?

_Jack:_ Maybe they realized they are wrong, that's why they try to avoid?

_Wife:_ Remember last weekend was your turn to cook and you prepared a curry with too much salt. And your friends were here, during lunch and they diluted curry themselves and continued to chat & laugh during the whole time? Do you know why?

_Jack_: Isn't that the dining courtesy? Continue..

_Wife:_ They valued the occasion and our friendly relationship more than the curry. Isn't it?

_Jack:_ I'm a bad cook

_Wife:_ No, you're not. You made a mistake and To Err is human. They cared about you and ensured you save face. They tried fixing the problem themselves if they could, otherwise tell you in private if you can fix the problem.
| What if they yelled at the dining table that the food is non-palatable?

_Jack:_ It would have been a day to forget. Are you saying I should not point mistakes?

_Wife:_ Not really. You can't get angry 20 times a year. Once a year to get your points across is good, but otherwise it will be ignored/labeled.

_Jack:_ Understand. I agree. I should have given the other team the benefit of doubt, I concluded things myself.

###### Some tips:

-- Leaders are people and relationships first

-- Separate people from the problem

-- Focus on underlying intent, concerns and always strive for joint-problem solving

-- Give people the opportunity to admit and fix their own mistakes, if they can

-- Discuss alternatives. If they are not involved in the process, they are unlikely to approve the final product

_Wife:_ Now that you realize, How are you going to clear the mess?

_Jack:_ Not sure. I know it takes 4 good things to make someone forget 1 bad thing. I should have been more careful.

_Wife:_ It is not that you're all wrong on your part. You had the best of intent for the project to be successful.

> Watch out for not just "What you say!" but "How you say it!"

_Wife:_ Relax. Sleep well. Everything will be alright.
